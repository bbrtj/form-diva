=head1 NAME
 
Form::Diva - Generate HTML5 form label and input fields

=head1 SYNOPSIS
 
Generate Form Label and Input Tags from a simple data structure.
Simplify form code in your views without replacing it without a lot of even
uglier Perl Code in your Controller. 

Drastically reduce form clutter in your View Templates with small Data Structures.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Create a new instance of Form::Diva from an array_ref of hash_refs describing each field of your form. The most common attributes have a single letter abbreviation to reduce typing.

Return a similar structure of the label and input attributes ready for inclusion in a web page by your templating system.

=head1 USAGE

 use Form::Diva;

 my $diva = Form::Diva->new(
    label_class => 'col-sm-3 control-label',
    input_class => 'form-control',
    form        => [
        { n => 'name', t => 'text', p => 'Your Name', l => 'Full Name' },
        { name => 'phone', type => 'tel', extra => 'required' },
        { qw / n email t email l Email c form-email placeholder doormat/},
        { name => 'myradio', type => 'radio', default => 1,
           values => [ "1:Yes", "2:No", "3:Maybe" ] },   
    ],
 );

 my $fields = $diva->generate;
 my $filledfields = $diva->generate( $hashref_of_data );

Once you send this to your stash or directly to the templating system the form might look like:

  <form class="form-horizontal well col-md-8" role="form"
   method="post" action="/form1" name="DIVA1" >  

  <div class="form-group">
In Template Toolkit:
  [% FOREACH field IN fields %] {
    [% field.label %]
    <div class="col-sm-8">
        [% field.input %]
    </div>
  [% END %]
Or in Mojo::Template
  % foreach my $field (@$fields) {
    <%== $field->{'label'} %>
    <div class="col-sm-8">
        <%== $field->{'input'} %>
    </div>
 % }

 </div>

 <div class="form-group">
    <div class="col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-8">
      <input type="submit" class="btn btn-large btn-primary" 
      name="submit" value="submit_me" >&nbsp;
    </div>
 </div>
 </form>

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Create a new object from a Data Structure ().

=head2 generate

When called without arguments returns the blank form with placeholders and value set to default or null if there is no default.

When provided an optional hashref it sets values based on the hashref and suppresses placeholder. 

The data returned is in the form of an array reference with a hash reference for the label and input attributes.

=head2 spawn

Not yet implemented. The same as generate but specify which fields to include and or change field order.

=head1 The Form::Diva Data Structure

 { label_class => 'some class in your css',
   input_class => 'some class in your css',
   form        => [
        { name => 'some_field_name', ... },
        ...
   ],
 }

=head2 label_class, input_class

Specify the contents the label's class attribute and the input's class attribute. The input_class can be over-ridden for a single field by using the c/class attribute in a field definition.

=head2 form

Form::Diva knows about the most frequently needed attributes in HTML5 label and input tags. The attribute extra is provided to handle valueless attributes like required and attributes that are not explicitly supported by Form::Diva. Each supported tag has a single character shortcut. When no values in a field definition require spaces the shortcuts make it extremely compact to describe a field using qw/. 

The only required value in a field definition is name. When not specified type defaults to text. 

Multivalued fields are not currently supported, but may be in the future.

Supported attributes and their shortcuts

 c       class        over-ride input_class for this field
 d       default      sets value for an empty form
 e,x     extra        any other attribute(s)
 i       id           defaults to name
 l       label        defaults to ucfirst(name)
 n       name         field name -- required
 p       placeholder  placeholder to show in an empty form
 t       type         checkbox, radio, textarea or any input types
                      type defaults to text input type
 v       values       for radio and checkbox inputs only

=head2 extra attribute

The contents of extra are placed verbatim in the input tag. Use for HTML5 attributes that have no value such as disabled and any of the other attributes you may wish to use in your forms that have not been implemented, you will need to type out attribute="something" if it is not valueluess.

=head3 Common Attributes with no Value

B<disabled>, B<readonly>, B<required>

Should be placed in the extra field when needed.

=head2 TextArea

TextArea fields are handled the same as the text type. 

=head2 Radio Button and CheckBox

Radio Buttons and CheckBoxes are very similar to each other, and take an extra attribute 'values'. Form::Diva does not currently support multi-valued Radio Buttons and CheckBoxes, if a record's data has multiple values only one will be selected in the form.

=head3 values

For CheckBoxes the values attribute is just the values of the check boxes. If value is set and matches one of the values it will be checked. 

  { type => 'checkbox',
    name => 'mycheckbox',
    values => [ 'Miami', 'Chicago', 'London', 'Paris' ] }

For RadioButtons the values attribute is a number and text seperated by a colon. When the form is submitted just the number will be returned.

  { t => 'radio',
    n => 'myradio',
    v => [ '1:New York', '2:Philadelphia', '3:Boston' ] }

=head2 Select and Datalist

The select input type didn't make it into the initial release but is at the top of the list for features to implement.

Like Radio and Checkbox, Select and Datalist take a values argument. The values argument may be either a list to be used as both the value and the display value, or the values may the value from the display seperated by a colon : in each element of the array_ref.

        {   name    => 'checktest',
            type    => 'select',
            default => 'French',
            values  => [
                qw /Argentinian American English Canadian French Irish Russian/
            ]
        }  

Or if the values need to be different than what is displayed use a colon:
    [ 'usa:United States of America', 'china:Peoples Republic of China']          

head3 DataSet Support

DataSet is at present not supported by Safari and Internet Explorer. DataSet is similar to Select in that it takes an Option group, however, it is actually a text input not a select input.
